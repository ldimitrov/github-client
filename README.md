# github-client
A simple RESTful github client with spring boot 2 and retrofit

1. You would need to create an access token: 
https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

2. Then you need to set an OS env variable with your access token:

        export ACCESS_TOKEN=<YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN>
    
3. Run the app: 
            
        ./mvnw spring-boot:run
